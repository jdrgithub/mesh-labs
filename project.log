# Mesh Labs Project Log
# Comprehensive Istio Service Mesh Tutorial

## Project Overview
Building a professional-grade Istio service mesh tutorial with incremental lessons demonstrating core concepts.

## Lesson 3: Traffic Splitting (Canary Routing)
Goal: Route N% of traffic to v2 using only mesh config (no app code changes)

### Actions Taken:

1. **Project Analysis** - Analyzed existing project structure:
   - Namespace: mesh-demo with istio-injection enabled
   - Service: hello (port 8080, named "http" for L7 features)
   - Deployment: hello-v1 with ealen/echo-server image
   - Client: curl pod for testing

2. **Starting Lesson 3 Implementation** - Creating canary routing setup

3. **Lesson 3.1 - Deploy hello-v2** - Created deployment for v2
   - Deployed second version of hello service with version: v2 label
   - Same image and configuration as v1 for zero-downtime deployment testing

4. **Lesson 3.2 - DestinationRule** - Created destination rule configuration
   - Defined subsets v1 and v2 based on version labels
   - Enables fine-grained traffic control between versions

5. **Lesson 3.3 - VirtualService Weighted Routing** - Created multiple routing configurations:
   - Weighted routing configurations for traffic splitting
   - Various traffic distribution patterns (90/10, 50/50, 0/100, 100/0)

6. **Lesson 3.4 - Clean Traffic Switching** - Implemented zero-downtime deployment patterns
   - Gradual traffic shifting from v1 to v2
   - Instant rollback capability
   - No application code changes required

7. **Comprehensive README Creation** - Created detailed tutorial documentation
   - Step-by-step instructions for all 8 lessons
   - Verification commands and expected results
   - Troubleshooting guide and common issues
   - Professional-grade documentation with best practices

8. **Project Structure Completed** - Organized all files with clear naming conventions
   - Numbered directories for logical progression
   - Self-documenting YAML files with inline comments
   - Consistent metadata and labeling across resources

9. **Professional Project Restructure** - Transformed from tutorial format to production-ready project
   - Created manifests/base/ directory for core Kubernetes resources
   - Created configs/ directory with organized Istio configurations
   - Created scripts/ directory with automated deployment and testing tools
   - Created docs/ directory with comprehensive documentation
   - Added Makefile for common operations and automation

10. **Production-Ready Features Implemented**:
    - Resource limits and health checks for all deployments
    - Comprehensive error handling and validation
    - Automated deployment scripts with multiple configuration options
    - Professional testing framework with traffic distribution analysis
    - Monitoring and debugging tools with continuous monitoring capability
    - Security-first approach with deny-by-default authorization
    - Circuit breaker and outlier detection for resilience
    - Canary deployment patterns with header-based routing

11. **Documentation Created**:
    - ARCHITECTURE.md: Detailed system architecture and design patterns
    - DEPLOYMENT.md: Comprehensive deployment guide and troubleshooting
    - Updated README.md: Professional project overview with usage examples
    - Self-documenting code with inline comments throughout

12. **Automation and Tooling**:
    - deploy.sh: Automated deployment with multiple configuration options
    - test.sh: Comprehensive testing framework with traffic analysis
    - monitor.sh: Monitoring and debugging tools
    - Makefile: Common operations and shortcuts
    - All scripts include proper error handling and colored output
